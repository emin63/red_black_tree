# Red-Black Tree 

The C files in this package implement balanced binary trees using
the red-black paradigm.  I have written these functions in a very
general manner so that the key can be anything at all.  Each node of
the balanced binary tree must contain a key and a pointer to info.
The user defines what data-type the key is and provides a comparison
function for the keys.  The info can also be any kind of data type.
You might also want to take a look at the C++ version of red black
trees and interval trees.

# Thanks

Thank you to Gokce Toykuyu kindly for translating these into php
with the accompanying `*.php` versions.
